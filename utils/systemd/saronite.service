# This is necessary because solred does not yet support
# writing a PID file, which means systemd tries to guess the PID
# by default, but it guesses wrong (sometimes, depending on
# random timing of events), because the daemon forks twice.
# The ultimate fix is for the daemon to write a PID file, and
# a workaround is to disable the guessing feature in systemd.
